# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification using EfficientNet-B0

This project performs multi-class classification of brain tumor MRI scans using a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model. The model distinguishes between four tumor types â€” glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor â€” with nearly 99% accuracy. Built for real-world reliability and supported with explainability techniques like Grad-CAM.
